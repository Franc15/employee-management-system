# Employee Management System

## Overview
This Employee Management System is a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing employee records. It implements basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and includes features such as validation, exception handling, and API documentation.

## Features
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records
- RESTful API endpoints
- Data validation
- Global exception handling
- API documentation with Swagger
- Basic authentication
- Unit and integration tests

## Technologies
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.3.0
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database (for development)
- Spring Security
- Swagger for API documentation
- JUnit 5 and Mockito for testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17 or later
- Maven 3.9.7 or later

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone 
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd employee-management-system
    ```
   
3. Build the project:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
   
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
   
5. Access the API documentation at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

## API Endpoints
- POST /api/employees - Create a new employee
- GET /api/employees - Get all employees
- GET /api/employees/{id} - Get an employee by ID
- PUT /api/employees/{id} - Update an employee
- DELETE /api/employees/{id} - Delete an employee

## Authentication
The API uses Basic Authentication. Use the following credentials:
- Username: user
- Password: password

## Running Tests
To run the tests, execute:
```bash
mvn test
```

## Future Improvements

1. **DTO Implementation**: Introduce Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for request and response payloads. This will provide better control over what data is exposed through the API and allow for easier versioning.

2. **Custom Response Bodies**: Implement a standardized response structure for all API endpoints. This could include metadata such as status codes, error messages, and pagination information.

3. **Advanced Search Functionality**: Implement more complex search operations, allowing filtering by multiple fields.

4. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging throughout the application for better monitoring and debugging.

5. **API Versioning**: Introduce API versioning to allow for future changes without breaking existing client integrations.

6. **OAuth2 Authentication**: Replace Basic Auth with a more secure OAuth2 implementation.

7. **Auditing**: Add auditing features to track changes to employee records, including who made the changes and when.

8. **Database Migration**: Implement a database migration tool like Flyway or Liquibase for better database schema management.

9. **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages in API responses.

10. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse.

11. **API Documentation Enhancements**: Provide more detailed API documentation, including example requests and responses.

12. **Performance Testing**: Implement performance tests to ensure the system can handle expected loads.

13. **Containerization**: Dockerize the application for easier deployment and scaling.

14. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
